Great work.

Minor suggestion for README files in Markdown: you can format code by using triple backticks. See "Fenced code blocks" here: https://docs.github.com/en/github/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/creating-and-highlighting-code-blocks

You can also add empty lines to get line breaks: https://gist.github.com/shaunlebron/746476e6e7a4d698b373
