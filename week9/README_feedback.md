This looks really awesome! One small thing: Right now, you're just reporting the genes with p-values less than 0.1. This is not the same thing as the genes significant at an FDR of 0.1. The statsmodels package has tools for multiple testing correction including fdr correction. Let a TA know if you ned help with this. (-0.5). Everything else is great!
