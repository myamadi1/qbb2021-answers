Hi Maryam, 

- In the future, can you upload a single .txt file (e.g., from textmate) with everything you did on the command line? It's much easier to read and diagnose any concerns that way 
- For the Manhattan, we wanted you to a) plot the most significant SNPs in a different color and b) label the 5 most significant SNPs with their rsID (-.75). Please update
- For the boxplot, please label in more detail - I'm left wondering which dataset and SNP we're looking at
