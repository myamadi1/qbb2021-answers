1c. Keep in mind that we have two ends for each set of reads, so the coverage should be twice what you have here. Also when we add them together, we do legitimately add. So the total coverage is 60X (-0.1)
4c. Close. The assembly has 1 insertion relative to the reference and 5 deletions. Insertions and deletions don't cancel out. You can have an insertion in one place and a deletion in another (-0.1)

4.8/5
