Great work. 

Minor suggestion:

- For the histogram, while the maternal and paternal histograms have the same number of bins (30 each), the width of the bins are different for the two groups, which could be misleading when placing them on the same plot. Instead of controlling the number of bins, you could try setting the bin width to some fixed value.

- For a challenge, try answering question 10, but with respect to the model you fit in question 9 (the t-test).
